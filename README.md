# SkillZone

> 🎓 **College Project Status**: This is an ongoing college project currently in active development. Features and functionality are being continuously added and refined.

A modern e-learning platform built with Flutter, featuring a clean and intuitive interface for an enhanced learning experience.

## 💡 Project Concept

SkillZone introduces an innovative approach to e-learning through a unique points-based progression system:

### Points & Skills System
- 🎯 **Dual Learning Path**: The platform distinguishes between Soft Skills and Hard Skills courses
- 🆓 **Free Soft Skills**: Access to comprehensive soft skills courses (leadership, communication, etc.) at no cost
- 💰 **Premium Hard Skills**: Technical courses (programming, design, etc.) are unlocked using points
- ⭐ **Points Economy**: 
  - Earn points by completing soft skills courses
  - Use accumulated points to unlock premium hard skills content
  - Progress through different levels (Rookie → Explorer → Achiever → Master → Expert)
- 🏆 **Level System**: Track your learning journey through achievement badges and level progression

This gamified approach encourages users to develop a well-rounded skill set, recognizing the importance of both technical expertise and interpersonal abilities in professional growth.

## 🚧 Development Status
Some features might be incomplete or subject to change as development progresses.
